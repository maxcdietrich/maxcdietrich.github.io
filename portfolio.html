			<h1>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1><br/><br/><br/>

			<p>[insert picture/carousel here]</p><br/><br/><br/>
			<h3>SharkNinja</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Winter – Summer 2018</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Mechanical Engineering &emsp; Experiment Design &emsp; Modelling</p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> During a 6 month co-op at SharkNinja I worked on developing predictive models for the runtime and performance of new cordless vacuums. My work focused on understanding the input and output variables of HEPA air filters so that factors such as power usage, suction, and cleaning could be modelled. My work over 6 months greatly advanced the company's knowledge of air filtration and reduced the power consumption of the Ion P50 filter by 10%. </p>

			<h3>Wireless Voice Amplifier</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Spring 2017</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Human Factors Design &emsp; Electrical Engineering</p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> For the class Engineering for Humanity a team of myself and two other sophomores paired with a man who had Parkinson’s Disease to create a product or service that could help him in his daily life. After doing extensive fieldwork and prototyping to understand the functional, interaction, and aesthetic needs of our partner we developed a wireless voice amplifier to help him be more active in social gatherings with friends and family. </p>

			<h3>3D Printed Prostate Phantom</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Summer 2016</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">CAD &emsp; Rapid Prototyping &emsp; 3D Printing</p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> Our team’s goal for this project was to make 3D printed models of a patient’s prostate that doctors could use to plan and test radiation therapy before actually exposing a patient to any radiation. I created many iterations and prototypes, each one incorporating my own test results, and the input of oncologists. The final parts were easier to use and produced more accurate results. </p>

			<h3>Electric Car Water Cooling</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Fall 2016 – Spring 2017</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Solidworks &emsp; Thermal Analysis &emsp; Design for Manufacturing</p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> This was the first year that Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM) used a water cooling system for the FSAE competition. I lead a small team working to gather knowledge about the thermodynamics of water cooling and later designing the system in CAD and building it on the car. </p>

			<h3>OEM High Voltage Enclosure</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Spring 2016</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Inter-team collaboration &emsp; Enclosure Design &emsp; Solidworks</p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> The second major project that I worked on for Olin Electric Motorsports was an enclosure for many high and low voltage components including switches, batteries and PCBs. The obvious challenge of this project was keeping all of the electronics safe by making sure that the low voltage components (12V) were insulated from the high voltage components (over 100V). The challenges were increased, however, due to the fact that I had to meet two separate rule sets and because the mounting of these electronics was an afterthought in the design of the car so space was severely limited.</p>

			<h3>OEM Transmission Design</h3><br/>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Fall 2015 – Spring 2016</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic">Solidworks &emsp; FEA &emsp; Design for Manufacturing </p><br/>
			<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract:</span> The first project that I worked on for Olin Electric Motorsports was completing a half finished chain reduction for our motors. I worked under the mentorship of our team project manager, along with two other first year students, to complete critical features such as a chain guard, weight saving, and sleeves and clamps for bearings. After designing the parts and testing them with FEA I made most of the part drawings and fabricated many of the sheet metal parts. </p>
