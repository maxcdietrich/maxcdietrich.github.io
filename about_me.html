				<h1>Here's a little bit <span style="color: #0080FF">about me</span>.</h1>

				<p style="text-align: left">I’m from Houston, Texas, and I am currently a mechanical engineering student at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, class of 2019. Some of my favorite classes have been those where I can practice user centered design and use fascinating technology to improve people’s lives.

				<br/><br/>The most important skill that I have learned at Olin is how to be a problem solver. I often take on projects in areas that I am unfamiliar with. Throughout the project, I do extensive research to understand the problem and develop the right solution. This portfolio captures some of the projects that are meaningful to me and the learning processes undergone in each one.
