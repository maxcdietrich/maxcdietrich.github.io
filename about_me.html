					<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

					<p style="text-align: left">Iâ€™m from Houston, Texas, and am currently a senior mechanical engineering student at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, class of 2019. My passions are studying how systems and people work and then using that knowledge to make creative solutions.

					<br/><br/>My current career intrests are in consumer goods, research and development or any field that gives me a chance to solve problems to improve the lives of others.  My protfolio shows some of my past experiences in these fields.  Away from work, I like to spend my time playing disc golf, baseball, and the guitar.
